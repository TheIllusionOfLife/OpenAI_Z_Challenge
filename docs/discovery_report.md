# OpenAI to Z Challenge: Archaeological Site Discoveries in the Amazon

## 1. Executive Summary / 200-word Abstract
[To be filled - This will be the 200-word summary for the submission form. This section should briefly outline the project's goal, methods, key findings (e.g., number of potential sites identified), and their significance.]

## 2. Introduction
This document details the methodology and findings of our participation in the "OpenAI to Z Challenge," aimed at discovering unknown archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon, a region of immense biodiversity and rich pre-Columbian history, holds many secrets yet to be unveiled. This project leverages advanced remote sensing data and machine learning techniques to contribute to these discoveries.

## 3. Data Sources
The analysis utilized a combination of geospatial and textual data:
- **LiDAR Point Cloud Data**: Provided high-resolution terrain models, crucial for identifying subtle topographical anomalies indicative of human activity. (Source: Competition-provided)
- **Satellite Imagery**: Offered multispectral views for land cover analysis and visual feature detection. (Source: Competition-provided)
- **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) Data**: Helped in assessing vegetation health and density, which can correlate with past land use. (Source: Competition-provided or derived)
- **Geographic Information System (GIS) Data**: Included information on topography, hydrography, and existing land use. (Source: Competition-provided)
- **Archaeological Literature Data**: Contained information from past research, including known sites, which aided in model training and validation. (Source: Competition-provided)

## 4. Methodology
Our workflow was structured into several key phases:

1.  **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**:
    This involved cleaning the raw data, unifying coordinate systems, and extracting relevant features. For LiDAR, this included generating DTM, slope, and aspect. For satellite imagery, various vegetation indices and textural features were computed. (Detailed in `notebooks/phase1_data_preprocessing/01_initial_data_exploration.ipynb`)

2.  **Model Building and Training**:
    We experimented with [mention models, e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, and a CNN]. The models were trained on features extracted from the data, with labels derived from [explain how labels were derived, e.g., known sites from literature, or synthetically generated based on characteristics]. (Detailed in `notebooks/phase2_model_building/02_model_building_and_evaluation.ipynb`)

3.  **Prediction and Candidate Site Identification**:
    The trained model(s) were applied to the study area to predict the likelihood of archaeological presence for unexplored locations.

4.  **Validation and Confidence Assessment**:
    Potential sites were cross-referenced with archaeological literature (DOIs, LiDAR Tile IDs, etc.) and other supporting data. A confidence score (e.g., High, Medium, Low) was assigned to each discovery. (Detailed in `notebooks/phase3_validation/03_discovery_validation.ipynb`)

## 5. Results: Discovered Sites
[This section will be populated with a list or table of the most promising discovered sites. Each entry should ideally include:]
-   **Site ID/Reference**: A unique identifier for the discovery.
-   **Coordinates**: Latitude and Longitude.
-   **Description of Features**: e.g., "Possible earthworks," "Circular depression," "Anomalous vegetation pattern."
-   **Model Confidence**: The probability or score assigned by the model.
-   **Validation Confidence**: Our assessed confidence after cross-referencing.
-   **Supporting Evidence**: Links to literature (DOI), LiDAR Tile ID, or notes on visual confirmation from imagery.

**Example Table Format:**
| Site ID | Latitude | Longitude | Features Detected | Model Score | Validation Conf. | Supporting Evidence (DOI, Tile ID, Notes) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P001    | -X.XXXX  | -Y.YYYY   | Raised linear features, possible platform | 0.89        | High             | Matches description in [DOI], visible on LiDAR tile [ID] |
| P002    | -A.AAAA  | -B.BBBB   | Circular feature, anomalous NDVI        | 0.75        | Medium           | Clear visual anomaly on satellite, no direct literature match |
| ...     | ...      | ...       | ...               | ...         | ...              | ... |

## 6. Model Performance
[Briefly describe the performance of the primary model used for generating the discoveries. Include key metrics if available, e.g., F1-score, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC on a held-out test set or through cross-validation.]
- Model Used: [e.g., XGBoost]
- Key Metric (e.g., F1-score on validation set): [e.g., 0.78]

## 7. Discussion
[Interpret the findings. What types of sites were commonly identified? Were there any surprising discoveries? Discuss any challenges faced during the project, such as data quality issues, computational limitations, or difficulties in validation.]

## 8. Conclusion and Future Work
This project successfully demonstrated a workflow for identifying potential archaeological sites in the Amazon using [mention key techniques]. We identified [Number] potential sites that warrant further investigation.
Future work could involve:
-   Acquiring higher-resolution data for promising areas.
-   Incorporating additional data sources (e.g., soil data, ethnohistorical records).
-   Field verification of high-confidence sites by archaeological teams.
-   Refining models with feedback from expert reviews.
